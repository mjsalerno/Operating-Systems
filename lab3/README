Describe how you implemented the main programming assignment. The README
file should describe what you did, what approach you took, results of any
measurements you made, which files are included in your submission and what
they are for, etc.  Feel free to include any other information you think is
helpful to us in this README; it can only help your grade.


mutex-trie: make a static mutex. every time a thread wanted to read or write to 
node try to lock the mutex. once job is finished unlock the mutex. 

rw-trie: made a static rw lock. if a thread only wants to read from a node
get a read lock if a thread wants to write to a node then get a write lock
once task is done unlock the lock

fine-trie: created a mutex in the node struct. everytime a thread passed over the 
node to read/write, get the lock. each thread while travilling the trie always has a 
of the node it is looking at and its parent and "walks down the trie"
release locks when task is complete
